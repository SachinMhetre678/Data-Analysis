## 🔍 Key Steps and Methodology

1. **Mockup Review and Business Requirements Discussion**  
   The project begins with an in-depth review of the dashboard mockup and business requirements. This step helps clarify stakeholder expectations and sets the foundation for building a dashboard that meets specific needs.

2. **Data Transformation with Power Query**  
   Using Power Query, we handle initial data cleaning, transformation, and preparation. This process involves structuring the data for efficient use in the dashboard, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

3. **Building Metrics Using DAX**  
   DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is employed to build essential metrics for the dashboard. This involves creating calculated columns, measures, and other dynamic metrics that enhance the dashboard’s functionality.

4. **Stakeholder Review**  
   Midway through the project, stakeholders review the dashboard. This feedback loop ensures that the dashboard is on track and aligns with business goals, allowing adjustments based on stakeholder feedback.

5. **Final Review and Closing**  
   After implementing feedback and final touches, the project concludes with a final review, ensuring that all requirements are met and the dashboard is ready for use in business decision-making.
